Hi, I’m Matías Bernhardt—an IT system administrator, web designer, and all-around tech enthusiast with a strong creative side. For over 16 years, I’ve been working in IT infrastructure, automation, and development, always striving to make systems more efficient, secure, and scalable. I love diving into scripting with PowerShell and Python, managing servers, and exploring emerging technologies like cloud computing and AI. There’s always something new to learn, and that’s what keeps me motivated.  

But technology is just one side of me. I’ve always had a passion for design, whether it’s creating websites, working on UX/UI concepts, or experimenting with digital and traditional art. Over the years, I’ve built websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, and Magento, and I still enjoy crafting user-friendly experiences. At the same time, I love sketching with pencil and ink, and I’m fascinated by how AI is shaping the creative world. There’s something exciting about blending technology with artistry, and I’m always exploring ways to merge the two.  

Outside of work, I’m a husband, a proud father to an amazing son, and I share my home with a curious cat. When I’m not in front of a computer screen, I’m probably watching football (both soccer and American football) or following the latest Formula 1 race. But what really drives me is the need to create—whether it’s building a smart home automation system, improving something around the house, working on a woodworking project, or writing a blog. I love taking ideas and turning them into something tangible, whether digital or physical.  

Technology, creativity, and curiosity fuel everything I do. If you’re passionate about any of these topics, I’d love to connect—there’s always something new to build, learn, or explore!
